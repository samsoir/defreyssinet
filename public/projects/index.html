  <p>I have been working in the computer industry since 2001. In that time I have worked on a number of exciting projects across a broad spectrum of industries. I have catalogued some of those projects here due to the brevity of their existence.</p>

<p>Although I will only refer to the roles I participated in across these various endeavours, almost all of the projects listed here were only possible due to a team of highly talented people that I am consistently in awe of.</p>

<p>Sitterati is a new mobile product from Sittercity, America&#8217;s first and largest online sitter database. Sitterati provides a new and easy way for parents and sitters to manage and pay for child care on the go.</p>

<p>I am currently the Chief Technical Architect of Sitterati, responsible for design and delivery of all the technical aspects of the project. Additionally I manage a small team of very talented developers. This project has been one of the most challenging and rewarding I have worked on in recent years.</p>

<p>Sitterati was publicly launched in the United States in January 2013 for iPhone.</p>

<p>Comic Relief had to support a large online fundraising community for the Sport Relief 2012 campaign. FROST is a system designed to provide online community fundraising, payment processing and online retail to support Sport Relief. However FROST was also built to provide Comic Relief with a fundraising platform for all of their future campaigns, as well as support for other charities.</p>

<p>I provided the System Architecture for FROST, responsible for designing and specifying the core architecture for the platform. This resulted in a large specification document and a presentation to the FROST development team. I consulted with the development team to provide advice on tooling, frameworks and processes.</p>

<p>Sport Relief 2012 was a huge success raising £67,977,824 for charity. A large portion of the money raised was managed within the FROST system.</p>

<p>The Potato Council of England were launching a new campaign to promote British potatoes. They decided that rather than commissioning a traditional advertising campaign, they would instead build and distribute and free application. This application would educate the user to the nutritional value of potatoes compared with other foods. When a user discovered a new  nutritional fact about potatoes, they can post it to their Facebook wall.</p>

<p>I was approached to provide an answer to the brief supplied by the Potato Council. I submitted a design proposal for an iPad application based on the initial design ideas produced by the Potato Council. The iOS application was built and delivered in two weeks. I provided all the final user interface design and development services. Finally, I was also responsible for the successful submission of the application to Apple for review.</p>

<p>I was the senior software developer responsible for implementing a new authentication service to the platform. The new system used the OAuth 1 authentication protocol, providing authentication services to the entire Sittercity platform. It also provided support for handling remote authentications from other sites and services.</p>

<p>Whilst working on the core Sittercity product, I also was involved in rationalising the registration flows for sitters and parents and implementing a new promotional framework for new registrations.</p>

Working with designer <a href="http://yaili.com">Inayaili de León</a>, we collaborated on the new Kohana web site design and build. It was deployed with the release of Kohana Framework 3.2 in the summer of 2011.</p>

<p>The Open University wanted to provide their students with a new tool that would allow users create annotations on web sites.  The annotations created by a user could be either private, or shared with other users of the system, creating a community of users. The tool had to be implemented in javascript to ensure that no special browser plugins were required, and the tool would support the widest possible combinations of browsers.</p>

<p>I was a Technical Team Leader on the OU Annotate development project, initially managing a team of four developers. I provided the high level system architecture for the underlying API supporting the javascript client. Additionally I provided a design specification describing how the javascript client would manipulate the DOM to provide the visual feedback required by the project.</p>

<p>The OU Annotate tool is now available to all students of The Open University. There is a <a href="http://screencast.com/t/eh4Cu7GY">screencast demonstrating the tool</a> in action created by the Product Owner for Open University, Jenny Gray.</p>

<img src="/images/BBC-iPlayer-v3.png">

<p>In 2009 the BBC launched a new development project to migrate the existing BBC iPlayer v2 web site to the new BBC presentation framework. The new BBC presentation framework was a based on Zend Framework version 1, with BBC specific custom extensions. For over a year a BBC internal team developed the new iPlayer v3 service.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2010 performance testing of the new system prompted a new effort to improve the overall performance of the system. I joined the project to help integrate the BBC iPlayer v3 presentation system with a Varnish caching layer. Working with the BBC team we identified the dynamic and static areas of the iPlayer interfaces and devised a caching strategy for Varnish. I was then responsible for implementing the new hybrid presentation layer, integrating the BBC presentation layer with Varnish and javascript.</p>

<p>The BBC iPlayer v3 product launched as a beta in June 2010 and fully replaced the v2 system in September. The product has exceeded all performance benchmarks required by BBC management. As of January 2013, the iPlayer v3 system is still in production.</p>

<p>On a personal note; The BBC iPlayer v3 project was one of the most enjoyable projects I have been involved with. I believe I share the same feeling as the entire team working on this project, that it is one of the projects I am most proud of to this day.</p>

<p>In 2009 Cable&Wireless Worldwide (now part of Vodafone) required a new portal for their enterprise customers. The system would provide a single point of presence for Cable&Wireless Worldwide B2B customers to manage their accounts, report faults with their infrastructure and track the progress of any trouble tickets.</p>

<p>I joined the team in August 2009 to provide the presentation layer integration with a custom built service layer. I designed and implemented a new <a href="https://github.com/inviqa/SCIL">Service-Relational-Mapping framework</a> (now Open Sourced by <a href="http://inviqa.com">Inviqa</a>) to represent the service layer API entities as first class objects in the presentation layer.</p>

<p>In 2010 I became the Technical Team Lead on the MyCW Customer Portal project responsible for all day to day development. During this time I lead a project to improve the overall performance of the entire system by introducing optimisations and Varnish caching across the various service tiers.</p>

<p>The MyCW Customer portal supported a large portion of Cable&Wireless Worldwide&#8217;s B2B customers up until their acquisition by Vodafone in 2012.

<p>In 2008 Mukuru.com decided they needed to replace their existing PHP4 based web site with a new money transfer platform. This would require a complete re-write of the entire system, which had been continually developed for over four years at that point.</p>

<p>I provided a new system architecture for the money transfer platform that would enable Mukuru.com to support their existing customers sending money from the UK to Zimbabwe and South Africa. However, the system architecture also was designed to support money transfers between any two countries globally.</p>

<p>I was responsible for the overall implementation of the new money transfer platform. This included providing the development team with design direction, and providing scalable ways to deal with a seemingly endless list of payment processing companies and banks.</p>

<p>At the end of 2009 the new Mukuru.com system launched. Within six months Mukuru.com had launched a global money transfer operation supported by the new architecture.</p>

<img src="/images/Contact-Packaging.png">

<p>Contact Packaging wanted to expand their existing operations from an antiquated order system that was not online. This required a new online store to be created that would provide a customer experience as well as a back-office administration tool.</p>

<p>I joined the project to provide the system architecture and design for the store and administration system. The system I designed was a custom build based on the specifications supplied.</p> 

<p>This was the last project I ever worked on that I did not prescribe using an existing software framework. I am still proud of this project as it was one of my first truly successful systems built from the ground up. But if I were working on this project today, I would have turned to a solution like Magento to provide the backbone of the system. <em>If only Magento was stable when this project kicked off</em>.</p>

<p>Although I had worked on a number of system architectures up until this point, this was the first and last that I designed every single component for without using a PHP framework. For that reason, it will always be one I remind myself of whenever I set off on a new project.</p>
