<p>The ambition of web applications has only been impeded by the economies of scaling. The Hierarchical-MVC pattern enables ambitious applications to be designed without worrying about the dreaded 'S' word.</p>
<p>This talk will provide an overview of how to build applications that scale vertically and horizontally effortlessly when using the HMVC pattern. We will examine how the request object can provide a cost effective way to create an application of services. Then we will see how interrogation of the request object can reduce the size of the codebase across the entire application.</p>
