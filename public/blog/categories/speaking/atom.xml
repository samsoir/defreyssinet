    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mobileconference.nl/">The Dutch Mobile Conference</a> in Amsterdam is once again being held this June. It is the third year this conference has been held in conjunction with its well established and lauded sibling, <a href="http://www.phpconference.nl/">The Dutch PHP Conference</a>. This year the focus of the Dutch Mobile Conference is returning to all things mobile, returning the subject matter to native mobile development as well as mobile web.</p>

<p>I was very fortunate to be able to speak at the inaugural <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/dutch-mobile-conference/">Dutch Mobile Conference</a> in 2012, and I am delighted to be asked to return to speak once more. This year I am going to be tackling the subject of Behaviour-Driven Development. BDD has been a subject that has found itself at home at many a PHP and Ruby conference in recent years. However it has been noticeably absent from the mobile gatherings. Very conscious of this, I have decided it is time to bring testing to the forefront of mobile development.</p>

<p>The talk I intend to deliver (<em>Ed:</em> yes it&rsquo;s still being written) will begin by explaining why BDD is so fundamentally important to software engineers, testers and business owners. This will give me the chance to introduce the uninitiated to the Gherkin domain-specific language for expressing behaviour, usually run by the Cucumber testing running framework. Once everyone is comfortable with Gherkin, I will switch my attention to delivering a mythical iOS application that has been defined in Gherkin. We will watch the tests fail inside of Calabash-Cucumber and then implement the logic to make them pass until finally, we have created a fully functioning awesome iOS application.</p>

<p>The talk is designed to be accessible for people of all levels of knowledge of BDD, Cucumber and Calabash. It is being constructed to be very demonstration driven, with live code and test examples throughout. All code will be available for people to try themselves from Github after the presentation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mobileconference.nl"><img src="/images/dmc_wide_speaker.png" alt="Dutch Mobile Conference" /></a></p>

<p>I am delighted to announce that I&rsquo;ll be speaking at the <a href="http://mobileconference.nl">Dutch Mobile Conference</a> in June 2012. I will be presenting <em>Ten considerations for taking a web business to the mobile market</em> on the Friday. The talk will provide attendees with ten useful considerations for taking an existing online business into treacherous world of mobile. Moving an established online business into the mobile domain sounds simple to say. In some cases, it can be simple to perform. But the reality for a lot of companies is that their present model does not necessarily work within a mobile context.</p>

<p>It is always a pleasure to visit Amsterdam, a city that Si√¢n and I enjoy visiting as often as possible. I will be staying on in Europe for a week after the conference to visit friends and family back in London. June cannot come soon enough for me.</p>
