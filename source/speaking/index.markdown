<p>Behaviour-Driven Development has become the standard development process for crafting software on the web. In recent years tools such as Cucumber and Bahat have elevated automated acceptance testing into the toolchain of any discerning software engineer. But what about the thriving world of mobile development? Is it possible to practice outside-in test driven development when creating iOS, Android or hybrid applications? This session will examine the relatively new and emerging world of Behaviour-Driven Development for mobile applications.</p>

<p>Using an automated acceptance test framework called Calabash, we will examine how to build applications that are continuously tested against product requirements written in the Gherkin domain-specific language. Using the outside-in development method, a basic mobile application will be constructed during the session, precisely meeting the product owners requirements.</p>

<p>The ambition of web applications has only been impeded by the economies of scaling. The Hierarchical-MVC pattern enables ambitious applications to be designed without worrying about the dreaded 'S' word.</p>
<p>This talk will provide an overview of how to build applications that scale vertically and horizontally effortlessly when using the HMVC pattern. We will examine how the request object can provide a cost effective way to create an application of services. Then we will see how interrogation of the request object can reduce the size of the codebase across the entire application.</p>
