Hi I am Sam. I am a software developer and architect, mostly working in PHP, Ruby, and Objective-C/Cocoa. Most of my time is spent living and working in Chicago, Illinois. But don't let that fool you! I originate from London, but currently enjoying a stint at being a *legal alien* in America's Mid-West.

I have particular interest in developing system architectures for large scale applications, predominantly on the web. I am also interested in mobile development for iOS (both iPhone and iPad). I spend a lot of time messing around with various personal projects that rarely see the light of day. An advocate of Open Source, I am a core contributor to the [Kohana Framework](http://kohanaframework.org) project.

You can hire me through Adapter Pattern for your own projects. I have worked with many international clients of all sizes from the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk) to [Sittercity](http://www.sittercity.com), [Comic Relief](http://www.comicrelief.com) to [The Open University](http://www.ou.ac.uk).

On the rare occasions when I am not sitting in front of a computer, I usually occupy my time with making bread, reading, cycling and in the winter months snowboarding.

*Warning: I can talk endlessly about snowboarding given half a chance!*
