<p>I am delighted to announce that I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://mobileconference.nl">Dutch Mobile Conference</a> in June 2012. I will be presenting <em>Ten considerations for taking a web business to the mobile market</em> on the Friday. The talk will provide attendees with ten useful considerations for taking an existing online business into treacherous world of mobile. Moving an established online business into the mobile domain sounds simple to say. In some cases, it can be simple to perform. But the reality for a lot of companies is that their present model does not necessarily work within a mobile context.</p>

<p>It is always a pleasure to visit Amsterdam, a city that Si√¢n and I enjoy visiting as often as possible. I will be staying on in Europe for a week after the conference to visit friends and family back in London. June cannot come soon enough for me.</p>
